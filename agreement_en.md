### Introduction: Our Commitment to Security and Transparency

At **{{COMPANY_NAME}}**, we are committed not only to achieving attractive returns for our investors but also to ensuring the highest level of security and transparency. As detailed in the investment agreement, your investment is secured by collateral (a Security Interest) on the real estate assets and contractual rights held by the dedicated investment company, **{{GROUP_NAME}} LLC**, and its subsidiaries.

While we are confident in our business model and our ability to meet all commitments, as part of professional and transparent risk management, we have prepared a clear mechanism that allows investors in the group to act in a coordinated and effective manner in the unlikely event of a default by the company. This framework is designed to give you, the investors, collective control and power to protect your interests.

### The Challenge: Coordination Among Multiple Investors

In an investment group with multiple investors, all of whom have a security interest in the same pool of assets, uncoordinated action in the event of a default can lead to inefficiency, duplicated legal costs, and even conflicting decisions. This is particularly true when investors are in different countries (such as Israel and the USA).

### The Solution: The "Investor Representative" Mechanism

To address this challenge, the investment agreement includes a built-in mechanism for electing an "Investor Representative" who will act on behalf of all investors in the group in the event of a default that is not rectified by the company.

**How the Mechanism Works:**

1.  **Trigger:** The mechanism is automatically activated only if an "Event of Default" occurs as defined in the investment agreement (typically, failure to pay principal or interest), and the company does not cure the default within the specified "Cure Period" (approximately 21 business days).
2.  **Representative Election:**
    *   Following the trigger, a voting process will be held among all investors in the **{{GROUP_NAME}}** group.
    *   The vote will be based on a qualified majority determined by the investment size (e.g., a majority of **75%** of the total investments in the group will be required to elect a representative).
    *   Investors may choose one of the leading investors in the group or an external professional (such as a trustee or an agreed-upon law firm) to serve as the representative.
3.  **Role of the Representative:**
    *   To serve as the central point of contact for all investors in the group with the company and third parties.
    *   To coordinate communication among the investors.
    *   To receive a mandate from the investors (through a vote) to formulate and approve a strategy for realizing the collateral.
    *   To hire and instruct, on behalf of the investors, the US law firm that will handle the actual collateral realization procedures according to applicable law (UCC, relevant real estate laws).
4.  **Collective Decision-Making:** Substantive decisions regarding the manner and timing of collateral realization (e.g., approving a settlement, selling assets, distributing proceeds) will be made by a majority vote of the group's investors (again, based on investment size). The representative will act in accordance with these decisions.
5.  **Costs:** The costs associated with the representative's activities and the legal proceedings for realizing the collateral will be borne by the investors in the group, proportional to their investment, and will be deducted from the proceeds received from the asset realization. This ensures a fair and efficient distribution of the burden.

### Transparency and Ongoing Communication

We believe in full transparency throughout the life of the investment:

-   **Investor Portal Access:** Every investor has personal access to the system where they can view their investment details and payment history at any time.
-   **Regular Updates:** We will update all group members regarding new investors joining the group and any updates to the asset pool securing the group.
-   **Dedicated Investor WhatsApp Group:** Upon joining, you will be added to a dedicated WhatsApp group for investors in the **{{GROUP_NAME}}** group. This group will be used for ongoing updates from us and will also facilitate direct communication among the investors themselves, should they wish (especially in the event the representative mechanism is activated).

### Important Clarification: The Right to Individual Action

It is important to note that the collective representative mechanism does not legally negate the fundamental right of each investor to act independently to realize their security as permitted by the investment agreement and the law. However, we believe that collective action through an agreed-upon representative is the most efficient, cost-effective, and practical way for investors to protect their interests, especially given the complexity and cost of managing legal proceedings in the US on an individual basis.

### Special Considerations for International Investors

For investors outside the US, the collective representative mechanism offers significant additional advantages by dramatically saving on costs and logistical complexities associated with managing legal action from abroad.

### Conclusion

We are confident in our ability to manage the investments optimally and meet all our commitments. The collective action framework presented here is another layer in our commitment to transparency, professionalism, and the maximum protection of your interests.

We are happy to answer any questions on this matter.

Sincerely,
**The {{COMPANY_NAME}} Team**
