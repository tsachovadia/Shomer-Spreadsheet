# Core Automation Scripts

This directory is the heart of the Shomer Spreadsheet project. It contains the Python scripts responsible for all interactions with the Google Sheets data.

## Key Files

-   **`main.py`**: The main entry point for the automation. This script orchestrates the entire process of fetching, processing, and exporting data.

-   **`auth.py`**: Handles authentication with the Google Cloud Platform and Google Sheets API. It uses the `config.json` and `token.json` files to manage credentials.

-   **`list_sheets.py`**: A utility script to list all the sheet names (tabs) in a given Google Spreadsheet.

-   **`requirements.txt`**: A list of all the Python packages required to run the scripts in this directory.

-   **`config.json`**: Configuration file containing sensitive information like API keys and spreadsheet IDs. **This file should not be committed to version control.**

-   **`token.json`**: The authentication token generated by Google's OAuth 2.0 flow. It is created automatically after the user grants permission for the first time. **This file should not be committed to version control.**

## Formula Exports

The `/formula_exports` subdirectory is used to store CSV files that contain a full dump of all formulas from a spreadsheet. This is a critical tool for:

-   **Debugging:** Analyzing calculation errors by comparing formulas across different sheets (e.g., comparing a failing property sheet to a working one).
-   **Auditing:** Keeping a historical record of the sheet's logic at a specific point in time.
-   **Analysis:** Understanding the complex business logic without having to manually inspect every cell in the spreadsheet.
