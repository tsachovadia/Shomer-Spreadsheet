# Product Context

## Module 1: Land Contract (LC) Management
**Purpose:** This sheet is the central operational hub for a single Land Contract (LC). It tracks all financial details from two perspectives:
1. The Buyer's Loan: The standard amortization of the loan given to the home buyer.
2. The Company's Investment (as "Segula"): The performance and profitability of the LC note, which was purchased at a discount from the originating entity (e.g., "Chayil").

## Module 2: Aggregated Reporting
**Purpose:** Provides a high-level, dynamic financial overview of all properties for a user-selected period (Yearly, Monthly, or Quarterly).

## Module 3: Google Apps Script for Documentation
**Purpose:** This script automates the process of extracting and documenting all formulas from the key sheets in the spreadsheet. It is designed to be efficient by processing a "template" sheet once and assuming other "house" sheets follow the same structure, thus avoiding redundant processing and long execution times.
